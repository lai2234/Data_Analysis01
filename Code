#For example, do people order more junk food relative to other foods late at night?

# When is the time when people order the most?

#Subsetting Produce
produce = iod.loc[iod['department'] == 'produce']

#Subsetting to only hours and number of order at that specific hour
phrs = produce[['order_hour_of_day', 'num_orders_hour']]

#As we can see, 14:00 is the peak time when people purchase produce on the app.
#People purchase produce mostly in the afternoon
#The rising trend of the peak starts at 9:00am and slowing down at 4:00 pm





#Subsetting dairy eggs
dairyeggs = iod.loc[iod['department'] == 'dairy eggs']

#Subsetting only hour and number of order
dhrs = produce[['order_hour_of_day', 'num_orders_hour']]

#Bar chart
plt.ylabel('Number of Orders')

plt.title('Produce by hour of the day')

plt.bar(dhrs['order_hour_of_day'], dhrs['num_orders_hour'], color='green')

#As we can see, 14:00 is the peak time when people purchase dairy eggs on the app.
#People purchase eggs mostly in the morning and afternoon
#The rising trend of the peak starts at 8:00am and slowing down at 5:00 pm





#Subsetting beverage 
beverages = iod.loc[iod['department'] == 'beverages']

#Subsetting only hour and number of order
bhrs = produce[['order_hour_of_day', 'num_orders_hour']]

#Bar chart
plt.ylabel('Number of Orders')

plt.title('Produce by hour of the day')

plt.bar(bhrs['order_hour_of_day'], bhrs['num_orders_hour'], color='orange')

#As we can see, 14:00 is the peak time when people purchase beverages on the app.
#People purchase beverages mostly in the morning and afternoon.
#The rising trend of the peak starts at 7:00am and slowing down at 5:00 pm.


# Conclusion
In this project, I have discovered that :

- The majority of people shop at 2:00 pm as we demonstrated that by creating a bar chart of Produce, Dairy eggs, and Beverages.
- Produce has the most sold.
- Most of the trend of products ends in the afternoon.
- Despite 2:00 pm is the peak hour, the trend time for each product is different.
   - The trend of Produce starts at 9:00 am.
   - The trend of Dairy Eggs starts at 8:00 am.
   - The trend of Beverages starts at 7:00 am.
